Fantastic work, keep it up.

Great work with the derivation in the report, it is easy to follow your steps and what you are doing. Maybe you could have
said in the report that you included ghostcells in the implementation and thus having a different boundary implementation. 

I observe that your convergence rate numbers are not correct, however, since I did not achieve them, I do not know what 
to do to make them right. 

Tip: Include a .gitignore file so that all the thrash files that you do not want on your github does not get commited. 
This will make it easier to have a nice and structured repository.
