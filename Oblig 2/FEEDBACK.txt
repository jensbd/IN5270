- dt should be decided by dt <= dx/max_x(sqrt(q(x))), you can read about the
stability criterion. You will not get correct convergence rate when the program
does not follow the stability criterion.
- There is no calculation of the boundary conditions. You should read about
how to apply Neumann conditions.
- For d you are to apply x \in [-dx/2, L+dx/2]
- q_{i \pm 1/2} should be q(i*dx \pm dx/2), not just q(x_i)
- We are not to use the derivative of q in task b and c. For the interior points we
use the same equation as task a
- You could have iterated over more dx values.

Variables have reasonable names, but functions do not It's ok to follow what you are doing, but the
program lacks doc strings and there is an overuse of functions. Should break
the longer lines.

You should have submitted a report.
